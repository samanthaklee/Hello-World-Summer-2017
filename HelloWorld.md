## *About Me*

Hello beautiful people of Data Science! I am a 4th year Stats and Econ double major from the quaint southern Californian city of Los Angeles. I specialize in cheesy jokes and burning everything I (attempt) to cook, though dont let that deter you, I make great pasta. I'm hoping to pick up some Python skills and move on from my first language (*read: arch-nemesis*) R.
