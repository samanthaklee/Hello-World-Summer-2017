# Ash's Intro
Hey guys my name is Ashriful Dulla. I like long walks on the beach, listening to Frank Ocean in the park, and thinking existentially. Also I'm trying to learn as much as I can about data science and what gets me excited about it. 

Song to add: Pyramids by Frank Ocean, No Lie by 2 Chainz  

Project Proposal: 

I'm just going to plug the [little proposal I made on my github](https://github.com/ashriful/Save-Soundcloud). It's not fully fleshed out. I want to add more information on this soon. Note: I don't imagine this being the final project at all. I'm welcome to any ideas anyone has, I just wanted to showcase whatever I've worked on so far. If you're into music and more or less Spotify, I feel like we could make a pretty fun project.
