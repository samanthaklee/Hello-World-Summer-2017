# Hello World Data Science UCSB Summer 2017
## Repo for Markdown Practice Template

## Instuctions:
Now that you have gotten familiar with *markdown* I want everyone to create a branch on this repo. It should be called something like `sam_branch` and upload your file there. 

**DO NOT** change the master branch!

You can erase the original repo if you think it'll just be clutter on your personal *GitHub* account but everyone should create a branch on this repo from the meeting. 


Once you create the branch you should be able to upload your files into that branch I will include my branch and example template for y'all to reference. 

Any questions ask me on *Slack*!
