# Hi, I'm Shakuntala

## About Me
My name's Shakuntala! I was born in Australia, but I grew up in Pleasanton, CA, which is in the San Francisco East Bay Area. I'm a third year Biochemistry-Molecular Biology major here at UCSB with a minor in Statistical Science.
Biochemistry is love, biochemistry is life.

Aside from that, I do Judo and can kick your ass on Pokemon Showdown any day of the week. :)
