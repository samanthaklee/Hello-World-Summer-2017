## Intro

What's up everyone! My name is Jonathan, but you guys can call me Jon. I am a third year Communication major with plans to apply for a minor in journalism as well. I have a three year old German Shepard at home, who I always enjoy playing with. In my free time I enjoy watching Netflix, learning new programs, and playing the occasional video game. Recently I've been learning HTML and messing around in Photoshop. I am excited for what this year has in store for the Data Science club here at UCSB. Although I still have a long way to go in terms of learning how to code, I look forward to working with everyone and creating cool projects in the upcoming year.
