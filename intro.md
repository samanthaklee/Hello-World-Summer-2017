LASH TAN
=====

What's up, my name is Lash. I'm a pseduo-senior stats major, and I'm a non-traditional student. I'm 30 years old, so bring on the old man jokes.. I can take it :]

I'm pretty new to coding - I've taken CS16, but that's it. I look forward to group work, which is something I didn't really have any experience with in CS16.
