Hi guys,

I'm a computer science major going into my 3rd year.  Going to be the IT Director for Data Science this year, so feel free to Slack me if you need help with anything tech-related.

I like hiking, playing piano, playing video games, coding (of course).  I'll put songs on here shortly as soon as I get around to opening Spotify.

Project ideas:
- Adapt sentiment analysis algorithms to analyze browsing histories
- Machine learning on videos, try to predict the next frame based on the previous
- Same as the above, but with music.  Can a neural network make music?
- Something to do with analyzing and grouping people based on their interests.  basically ad profiling but transparent
- See if we can teach a neural net to recognize good coding practices vs bad ones
