Hi guys,

I'm a computer science major going into my 3rd year.  Going to be the IT Director for Data Science this year, so feel free to Slack me if you need help with anything tech-related.

I like hiking, playing piano, playing video games, coding (of course).  I'll put songs on here shortly as soon as I get around to opening Spotify.
